        <p>The FreeDict dictionary was converted from an SGML version of <q>Nowy Słownik
            angielsko-polski</q> (New English-Polish Dictionary) by <name>Tadeusz Piotrowski</name>
          and <name>Zygmunt Saloni</name> (1992). Warszawa: Editions Spotkania.
          ISBN-83-85195-81-5.</p>
        <p>The dictionary was created in TeX and converted to SGML by <name>Katarzyna
        Głowińska</name> and <name>Marcin Woliński</name> of the University of Warsaw.</p>
        <p>Idarex codes were added to it (possibly by Tadeusz Piotrowski and/or his students).</p>
        <p>The GNU release was facilitated by <name>Janusz S. Bień</name> of the University of
          Warsaw.</p>
        <p>The authors' licensing statement is included as PDF in the etc/ directory (the TEI
          version mentioned there is a different version produced by students of the University of
          Warsaw; that version was not used in the creation of the FreeDict dictionary).</p>
        <p>See the revisionDesc and the ChangeLog file for more details.</p>
        <p>The TeX, SGML and XML-ised SGML versions (the latter accompanied by an XSLT conversion
          script by Piotr Bański, included for verifiability and reproducibility of the results) are
          released together with release 0.1 of this dictionary.[note: the script appears to have been
          misplaced or overwritten, it will be added when/if found).</p>

            <item>anchored some of the POS values in the FreeDict interface to GOLD/ISO DCR (this is the reason for the version number change),</item>

          <item>converted SGML files to UTF-8;</item>
          <item>converted the transcription codes to IPA;</item>
          <item>created an XML DTD to validate the dictionary as XML, split all letters into separate files (e.g. "xyz" used to be a single file);</item>
          <item>very slightly corrected/modified the post-SGML version (it is released as one of the packages in version 0.1);</item>
          <item>converted codes into letters with diacritics in UTF-8;</item>
          <item>added non-diacritic versions to headwords with diacritics, to facilitate searches (e.g. <mentioned>pate</mentioned> to <mentioned>pâté</mentioned>; around 40 additions);</item>
          <item>the only lexicographic intrusion was splitting <mentioned>protégé</mentioned>/<mentioned>protégée</mentioned> to make them analogical to <mentioned>fiancé</mentioned>/<mentioned>fiancée</mentioned>, to make it easier to process them (note the difference in the POS: <mentioned>protégé</mentioned>/<mentioned>protégée</mentioned> is categorised as Adj, <mentioned>fiancé</mentioned> is N);</item>
          <item>wrote a conversion script to TEI XML (included with the post-SGML version as partial documentation);</item>
          <item>created this header, xincluding the individual letter files, so that the dictionary is easier to maintain;</item>
          <item>there are still a lot of fixes to do -- e.g. add entries missing in the SGML version (e.g. <mentioned>can</mentioned>! etc.) from the TeX version (a list by Radek Moszczyński is provided), fix POS (typo in inter(j), V Refl), unify the idarexen, join equivalents that were split around the '/' (km/h initially ended up as separate strings), split some ambiguous notes (e.g. 'gloss', see the conversion script for comments) into separate subclasses, split some comma-separated variant transcriptions into separate elements; separate regional variants Br/US from e.g. Latin expansions of some abbreviations (cf. <mentioned>cf.</mentioned>), which should not be located by headword queries (in this case, a query for <mentioned>confer</mentioned>);</item>
          <item>some entries that were proper subparts of other entries (mostly US spellings) were eliminated from the TEI version (but preserved in the post-SGML XML version) - the full list can be found in the XSLT conversion script;</item>
          <item>a separate item is extending the dictionary with an XML representation of idarexen (described in a paper by Bański and Moszczyński, LREC-08);</item>
          <item>the companion volume (pol-eng) awaits conversion from the TeX source;</item>
