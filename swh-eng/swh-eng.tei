            <p>This file in version 0.0.2 was compiled by <name>Beata Wójtowicz</name> from other electronic documents. It was based on <q>Swahili-Kiswahili to English Translation Program</q> by <name>Morris Fried</name> available from http://www.dict.org/links.html, which has been supplemented by entries from Freedict Swahili-English Dictionary (version 0.0.1) created by <name>Horst Eyermann</name> (http://www.freedict.de) from the Swahili-Esperanto and Esperanto-English Ergane dictionaries, available from http://www.travlang.com/.</p>
            <p>The December 2008 version (0.3), edited by <name>Beata Wójtowicz</name> and <name>Piotr Bański</name>, has been fixed syntactically, verified lexicographically and converted to the basic TEI P5 XML schema for dictionaries. The number of entries and the definitional parts have been extended. See the revisionDesc for subsequent changes.</p>

               <item>Technical changes vis-a-vis Freedict TEI-to-DICT scripts: looking for the balance between project-specific and Freedict-wide properties<list type="bulleted">
                     <item>Split <foreign>kwenye</foreign> in two (preposition + copula) - this is a technical move, to unify the nesting level of &lt;note&gt; elements with @type="cl-agr", but it's also in agreement with our POS strategy for this stage of the present dictionary: one entry per POS, and <foreign>kwenye</foreign> appears to have lexicalised from whatever -<foreign>enye</foreign> is into an uninflected preposition.</item>
                     <item>Moved class agreement information from the abused &lt;note&gt; elements into &lt;gramGrp&gt;, nested inside the regular &lt;gramGrp&gt;; this is another feature carried over from our Swahili-Polish-Swahili project. Unfortunately, &lt;gramGrp&gt; may not carry the @type argument. I could use a &lt;gram&gt; element for this without nesting gramGrps, but the nested gramGrp is intended as a feature structure that holds all agreement information in a single package.</item>
                     <item>All generated plural entries are now @type="pl" (by script). There are 522 such entries in this version.</item>
                     <item>xr/@type="plural-sense" is gone and replaced with the (abused) note/@type="def". This is to make sure that the content of generated plurals will be treated as single definitions later on.</item>
                     <item>note/@type="num" is augmented by @rend="noindent"; this is project-specific and pertains to the way the DICT databases are created. This is not meant to be filled by hand, a script does that when converting the editable dictionary into the final form.</item>
                     <item>The "tokens in definitions" count rose sharply because of the extra words "Plural of" repeated 522 times (they used to be part of &lt;xr&gt;) and also colons or sense numbers in some of the definitions of plurals. This may suggest a change of the formula for this count (or dropping it altogether). OTOH, ignoring plural entries from this count does not seem fair, given that they are by all means informative. The code is now <q>sum(for $txt in (/TEI/text/body/entry/sense//def/descendant::text() | /TEI/text/body/entry/sense/note[@type ne 'editor']/descendant::text()) return count(tokenize(normalize-space($txt),' ')))</q> - I have fixed it to catch all text nodes, which the previous counts didn't.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>The intended simplicity of encoding and incremental building of Freedict dictionaries relies to some extent on bordering on tag abuse. Instead of distinguishing between &lt;usg&gt; and &lt;note&gt; elements, I'd rather use more kinds of notes. Added: <list type="bulleted">
                     <item>@type="lbl" for notes within (definitional) notes - currently only labelling literal translations,</item>
                     <item>@type="usage" for notes describing the usage of the given headword/sense.</item>
                     <item>@type="dom" for crude characteristics of the domain of usage; includes hypernyms (date-fruit).</item>
                     <item>@type="obj" for typical object (most of these values come straight from the Guidelines).</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>Rule: all &lt;note&gt; elements that precede the given equivalent should be inside its &lt;def&gt; (for ease of transformation into c5 and CSS rendering only).</item>
               <item>Things that should eventually get beautified/modified (while keeping an eye on the balance between project-"neutral" tools and project-specific demands: <list type="bulleted">
                     <item>benki &lt;n&gt; (pl: {mabenki}) [sg=pl] - mark the lexical (class) ambiguity of the noun (or wait until class info is provided explicitly)</item>
                     <item>in some contexts, some elements are rendered in c5 with a preceding blank line. This is due to legacy code that doesn't really harm, so I do not intend to fix that for now</item>

               <item>Fixed mistakes found in version 0.3.</item>
               <item>Nouns of class 9 (the 'N class') are marked as 'type="N"' on their &lt;form&gt; element. This is used to signal that their plural forms (class 10) are identical to the respective singulars.</item>
               <item>Plural forms added in all applicable cases and identified the sg=pl pairs (= class N). Plurals are essentially back-references to singulars (citing their content), although in some cases, a specific "plural" (collective, mass) meaning is also provided. Note that e.g. the information on <foreign>benki</foreign> as seen in the browser view ("benki [sg=pl] (pl: mabenki)") signals that <foreign>benki</foreign> is ambiguous between class 9 (no plural marking) and class 5 (plural in ma-).</item>
               <item>Some classes of vocabulary added/expanded (e.g. names of countries and their inhabitants; the present-tense irregular paradigm of <foreign>wa na</foreign> added)</item>
               <item>No more parentheses inside &lt;def&gt; elements, more types of notes: <list type="bulleted">

               </item>

               <item>Redesign of the scheme for this dictionary (with focus on the microstructure).</item>
               <item>Setting the foundation for the subcategorisation of parts of speech -- currently used for pronouns (cf. <foreign>ake</foreign> or <foreign>hawa</foreign>) and causative verbs only.</item>
               <item>Partial introduction of singular-plural pairings (coded as a reference system, cf. <foreign>fanikio</foreign> vs. <foreign>mafanikio</foreign>).</item>
               <item>Irregular plurals are indicated, cf. <foreign>jambo</foreign>.</item>
               <item>Some other irregular inflections are also marked cf. <foreign>njoo</foreign> or <foreign>hakuna</foreign>.</item>
               <item>Added cross-entry references. Currently restricted to synonyms and the generalized "see also".</item>
               <item>Organized (sub)senses better.</item>
               <item>Added usage notes. Currently restricted to note/@type="hint" (and abused in imperative forms of verbs), pending the switch from the &lt;def&gt; system to the cit/quote system of the later stage of TEI P5. (Note that the CSS also supports &lt;note&gt; elements without the @type attribute - these are reserved for internal use and are removed from the final version or turned into XML comments).</item>
               <item>Equivalents are still listed in &lt;def&gt; elements (some of them separated by commas and with extra information in brackets, cf. <foreign>chako</foreign>). This is inherited from the earlier versions and will be changed in the next one.</item>
               <item>Eliminated entries for 'prepositional' phrases in <foreign>-a</foreign> -- their meanings can be regularly constructed from the relevant nouns. Eliminated double entries. Fixed malformed entries.</item>
               <item>The number of headwords increased from 1542 (including double entries and 'prepositional' phrases in <foreign>-a</foreign>) in version 0.0.2 to 2060 (count(//orth)) in version 0.3.</item>
               <item>The number of tokens in the definitional parts of entries, computed by sum(for $txt in //def | //note[@type='hint'] return count(tokenize(normalize-space($txt),' '))), increased from 2143 in version 0.0.2 to 4139 in version 0.3.</item>
               <item>Created and added a CSS stylesheet (linked by a processing instruction) to make maintenance and review easier.</item>
               <item>Expanded the header to provide more information and the change log.</item>
               <item>Added a DTD and a Relax NG schema, both derived from a TEI P5 ODD for with the Dictionaries module (attached).</item>
               <item>Bumped the version number up by one decimal point (this is no longer an alpha release), to 0.3.</item>
               <item>Some of the goals of the next version must be <list type="bulleted">
                     <item>better machine-readability (the cit/quote system with no commas or parentheses in the equivalents)</item>
